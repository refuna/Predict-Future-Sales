# Predict Future Sales

## Overview

The **Predict Future Sales**   aims to forecast sales for a retail store using historical sales data from a Kaggle competition. The goal is to build predictive models that can accurately estimate future sales based on various features, including product details, store information, and historical sales trends.

## Dataset

The dataset includes several CSV files, such as:

- **sales_train.csv**: Contains daily historical sales data, including product IDs, store IDs, sales amounts, and dates.
- **items.csv**: Contains information about the items, including their IDs and categories.
- **stores.csv**: Provides details about the stores involved in the sales.
- **test.csv**: The test set for making predictions, which includes product IDs and store IDs but lacks sales figures.

## Features

Key features of the project include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis, including handling missing values and converting date formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to identify patterns and relationships that can inform the modeling process.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that can improve the model's predictive power, such as aggregate sales metrics and time-based features.
- **Modeling**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) to forecast sales.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and comparing different models.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:
